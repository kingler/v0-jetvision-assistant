### 5. Dependencies Mapped ✅

Documented critical dependency chains:

**Week 1 Critical Path**:

DES-73 (TypeScript/Vitest) → Unblocks all development
DES-77 (Environment) → Unblocks Week 2 MCP servers
DES-78 (Clerk Auth) → Unblocks database and API work
```

**Week 2-3 Dependencies**:
```
MCP Base Infrastructure → All MCP servers
Database Schema → All agent implementations
All Agents → Integration tests
```

**Week 4-6 Linear Progression**:
```
Agents Complete → Frontend Integration → Testing → Production
```

## How to Use the System

### For Developers

**1. Find your tasks**:
```typescript
// View all your SubAgent tasks
mcp__linear__list_issues({
  project: "JetVision Assistant v1",
  label: "SubAgent:Coder"  // or your SubAgent role
})
```

**2. Start working**:
```typescript
// Update status to In Progress
mcp__linear__update_issue({
  id: "DES-73",
  state: "started"
})
```

**3. Track progress**:
```typescript
// Add progress comments
mcp__linear__create_comment({
  issueId: "DES-73",
  body: "✅ Red phase complete - All tests written"
})
```

**4. Complete work**:
```typescript
// Move to In Review or Done
mcp__linear__update_issue({
  id: "DES-73",
  state: "completed"
})
```

### For Project Managers

**View project status**:
- **Main Project**: https://linear.app/designthru-ai/project/jetvision-assistant-v1-8dc142d9fa78
- **Filter by Phase**: Use Phase labels to see weekly progress
- **Filter by Priority**: Track critical blockers
- **Filter by SubAgent**: Monitor workload distribution

**Track metrics**:
- Velocity: Issues completed per week (Target: 6-8)
- Cycle Time: Average time Todo → Done (Target: <3 days)
- Blocker Time: Time issues spend blocked (Target: <1 day)
- Handoff Efficiency: Time Coder → Reviewer → Done (Target: <2 days)
