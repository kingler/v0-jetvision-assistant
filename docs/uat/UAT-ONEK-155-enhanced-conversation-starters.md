**Date Generated**: 2026-02-08
**Branch**: `feature/onek-155-conversation-starters` (merged to `main` via `8910814`)

## Overview

This epic implements the Enhanced Conversation Starters system, providing users with contextual, actionable quick-start cards grouped into three categories: Specific Flight Requests, Deals Overview, and Pipeline Overview. The implementation uses a card-style layout (icon box + title + description) matching the existing landing page pattern. Key components include `StarterCard`, `ConversationStarterHub`, `useSmartStarters` hook, and category-specific starters (ActiveRequestsStarter, DealsStarter, HotOpportunitiesStarter, PipelineSummaryStarter). The feature has 49 passing tests across 1,199 lines of code with PRs #67, #76, #80, #81, and #83.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Conversation Starters Display as Card-Style Layout

**Given** the user opens a new chat session or views the landing page
**When** the conversation starters are rendered
**Then** each starter displays as a card with an icon box (colored background with icon), a title in medium font weight, and a description in smaller gray text -- matching the existing `LandingPage` component pattern

### AC-2: Starters Are Grouped by Category

**Given** the conversation starters are displayed
**When** the user views the available starter options
**Then** starters are visually grouped into three categories: Flight Requests (flight-related actions), Deals Overview (quotes, bookings, opportunities), and Pipeline Overview (sales metrics, request tracking)

### AC-3: Clicking a Starter Triggers the Appropriate Action

**Given** the user sees the conversation starters
**When** the user clicks on a specific starter card (e.g., "New Flight Request", "Show My Deals", "Pipeline Summary")
**Then** the corresponding action is triggered -- either populating the chat input with the appropriate prompt or directly initiating the relevant workflow

### AC-4: Starters Are Responsive on Mobile and Desktop

**Given** the conversation starters are rendered
**When** the viewport is resized between mobile (<768px) and desktop (>=768px)
**Then** the starters reflow appropriately -- cards stack vertically on mobile and display in a grid on desktop, with touch-friendly sizing on mobile

### AC-5: No Regressions in Existing Chat Interface

**Given** the conversation starters feature is deployed
**When** the user interacts with the chat interface normally (typing messages, receiving responses, viewing tool UIs)
**Then** all existing chat functionality works identically to before the feature was added, with no interference from the starters system

## Test Steps

### Test 1: Card-Style Layout Verification (Maps to AC-1)

1. Open the application at `http://localhost:3001`
2. Create a new chat session or navigate to the landing page
3. Observe the conversation starters displayed on the page
4. For each starter card, verify:
   - **Expected**: An icon box (colored square/rounded with an icon inside) appears on the left
   - **Expected**: A title in medium font weight appears next to the icon
   - **Expected**: A short description in smaller, gray text appears below the title
5. Compare the starter card style with existing landing page buttons
   - **Expected**: Visual style matches (border-2, hover:border-cyan-300 pattern)

**Result**: [ ] Pass  [ ] Fail

**Notes**: _______________

### Test 2: Category Grouping (Maps to AC-2)

1. View the conversation starters on the landing page or new session
2. Identify the category groupings
   - **Expected**: Flight-related starters are grouped together (e.g., "New Flight Request", "Active Requests")
   - **Expected**: Deals-related starters are grouped together (e.g., "Show My Deals", "Hot Opportunities")
   - **Expected**: Pipeline-related starters are grouped together (e.g., "Pipeline Summary")
3. Verify category labels or visual separation exists
   - **Expected**: Categories are visually distinct (either with section headers, spacing, or grouping)

**Result**: [ ] Pass  [ ] Fail

**Notes**: _______________

### Test 3: Starter Card Click Actions (Maps to AC-3)

1. Click on the "New Flight Request" starter card
   - **Expected**: Chat input is populated with a flight request prompt, or a new flight request workflow begins
2. Click on the "Show My Deals" or "Active Deals" starter card
   - **Expected**: The deals overview is triggered, showing current deals/quotes in the chat
3. Click on the "Pipeline Summary" starter card
   - **Expected**: A pipeline dashboard or summary is displayed in the chat thread
4. Click on the "Hot Opportunities" starter card (if visible)
   - **Expected**: Hot opportunity data is fetched and displayed
5. Verify each action triggers the correct workflow without errors
   - **Expected**: No console errors, no stuck loading states

**Result**: [ ] Pass  [ ] Fail

**Notes**: _______________

### Test 4: Mobile Responsiveness (Maps to AC-4)

1. Open DevTools and switch to a mobile viewport (iPhone 14 Pro, 390x844)
2. View the conversation starters
   - **Expected**: Cards stack vertically, one per row, with adequate padding
3. Tap on a starter card
   - **Expected**: Card responds to touch with hover/active state, action triggers correctly
4. Verify card touch targets
   - **Expected**: Cards are large enough to tap comfortably (44px+ height)
5. Switch to desktop viewport (1280x800)
   - **Expected**: Cards display in a multi-column grid layout

**Result**: [ ] Pass  [ ] Fail

**Notes**: _______________

### Test 5: Chat Interface Regression (Maps to AC-5)

1. After using a conversation starter, type a custom message in the chat input
   - **Expected**: Message sends and agent responds normally
2. Navigate to an existing session with tool UI cards
   - **Expected**: All existing TripSummaryCards, RFQ cards, and proposal cards render correctly
3. Return to the landing page or new session
   - **Expected**: Conversation starters are visible again and functional
4. Check browser console for errors
   - **Expected**: No errors related to conversation starters or chat rendering

**Result**: [ ] Pass  [ ] Fail

**Notes**: _______________

## Test Data & Environment

### Environment Requirements

- **URL**: `http://localhost:3001` (development) or staging URL
- **Branch**: `main` (merged via `8910814`)
- **Setup**: `npm install && npm run dev`

### Test Data

- **New session**: Create a fresh session to see starters on empty chat
- **Existing data**: Ensure the account has some active requests, deals, and pipeline data for meaningful starter responses
- **Related PRs**: #67 (base components), #76 (ActiveRequests), #80 (HotOpportunities), #81 (integration), #83 (Pipeline)

### Pre-Test Setup

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Verify the landing page loads with starter cards visible
4. Ensure Supabase connection is active (starters may fetch real data)
