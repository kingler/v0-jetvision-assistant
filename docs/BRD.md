## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Project Overview

**Project Name**: Jetvision AI Assistant

**Business Case**: Private jet charter brokers (ISO agents) currently spend 2-4 hours manually processing each flight request, limiting their capacity to ~5-8 requests per day. This manual bottleneck results in:
- Lost revenue opportunities during high-demand periods
- Delayed response times leading to customer churn
- Operational costs consuming 60%+ of broker time
- Inconsistent service quality and personalization

**Solution**: An AI-powered multi-agent automation system that processes flight requests from initial inquiry to final proposal in <5 minutes, enabling brokers to handle 10x more volume while improving customer experience and profit margins.

**Expected Business Value**:
- **Revenue**: $500K-$2M annual increase per broker (10x capacity)
- **Efficiency**: 85% reduction in processing time (4 hours → 5 minutes)
- **Profitability**: 40% margin improvement through automation
- **Scalability**: Support 500+ requests per broker per month
- **ROI**: 450% projected ROI within 12 months

### Strategic Objectives

1. **Market Leadership**: Establish Jetvision as the first fully automated private jet booking platform
2. **Operational Excellence**: Achieve industry-leading efficiency in RFP processing
3. **Customer Experience**: Deliver sub-5-minute proposal turnaround times
4. **Revenue Growth**: Enable 10x broker capacity without proportional staff increase
5. **Competitive Advantage**: Leverage AI to create defensible technological moat

### Project Scope

**In Scope**:
- Automated RFP workflow for private jet charter bookings
- Multi-agent AI system with 6 specialized agents
- Integration with Avinode (flight search/RFP), Gmail (communications), Google Sheets (client data)
- Real-time quote tracking and proposal generation
- Multi-tenant SaaS platform for ISO agents

**Out of Scope (Phase 1)**:
- Direct client self-service portal
- Multi-language support (English only in Phase 1)
- Mobile native apps (responsive web only)
- Batch RFP processing
- Integrated payment processing
- Operator onboarding portal

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Business Problem

#### Current State Pain Points

**Broker Challenges**:
1. **Manual Data Entry**: 30-45 minutes per request entering flight details into multiple systems
2. **Fragmented Information**: Client preferences scattered across spreadsheets, emails, notes
3. **Delayed Responses**: 2-4 hour turnaround time leads to lost deals (competitors respond faster)
4. **Limited Capacity**: Brokers handle only 5-8 requests/day due to manual overhead
5. **Inconsistent Quality**: Service quality varies based on broker memory and availability
6. **Reactive Operations**: No proactive insights into client preferences or patterns

**Business Impact**:
- **Lost Revenue**: $200K-$500K annually per broker due to missed opportunities
- **Customer Churn**: 25-30% of clients switch to faster competitors
- **High Operational Costs**: 60% of broker time spent on non-revenue activities
- **Limited Scalability**: Cannot grow without proportional headcount increase
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Losing market share to technology-enabled competitors

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Technical Risks

#### Risk 1: OpenAI API Reliability

**Description**: Dependency on OpenAI's infrastructure and API availability

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: High (system unusable if OpenAI down)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Cache common responses for degraded mode
- Monitor OpenAI status page for outages
- Have manual fallback workflow documented
- Set up Sentry alerts for API failures

**Contingency Plan**:
- Switch to Azure OpenAI Service (99.9% SLA)
- Implement Claude 3 Opus as backup LLM
- Queue requests during outages for batch processing

#### Risk 2: Avinode Integration Delays

**Description**: Avinode API approval may take longer than expected (5-10 business days)

**Probability**: High
**Impact**: Medium (delays Phase 2 delivery)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Initiate application process immediately
- Build mock Avinode MCP server for parallel development
- Establish direct contact with Avinode API team
- Maintain regular follow-up schedule

**Contingency Plan**:
- Launch with manual RFP fallback initially
- Partner with alternative flight search platforms
- Offer early adopters extended trial periods

#### Risk 3: Real-Time Update Scalability

**Description**: WebSocket connections may not scale to 10,000+ concurrent users

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Medium (degraded UX at scale)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Use Supabase Realtime (proven at scale)
- Implement connection pooling and load balancing
- Performance test at 10x expected load
- Monitor connection metrics in production

**Contingency Plan**:
- Fall back to polling with longer intervals
- Implement push notifications as alternative
- Use edge functions for regional distribution

### Business Risks

#### Risk 4: Slow User Adoption
