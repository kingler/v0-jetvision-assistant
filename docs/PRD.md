**Target Audience**: Developers, Product Managers, QA Engineers

---

## 1. INTRODUCTION / OVERVIEW

### Product Name
Jetvision AI Assistant

### Problem Statement
Private jet charter brokers (ISO agents) manually process flight requests through a time-consuming workflow that involves:
- Understanding client requirements and preferences
- Searching for available aircraft across multiple operators
- Creating and distributing RFPs (Request for Proposal) to operators
- Collecting and analyzing quote responses
- Generating personalized proposals for clients
- Managing email communications

This manual process takes 2-4 hours per request and is error-prone, leading to missed opportunities, customer dissatisfaction, and lost revenue.

### Solution
An AI-powered multi-agent system that automates the entire RFP workflow, reducing processing time from hours to minutes while maintaining personalization and accuracy through intelligent automation.

### Product Goal
Transform flight request processing for private jet charter brokers by providing a fully automated, AI-driven system that handles the entire workflow from initial request to final proposal delivery, increasing efficiency by 85% while improving customer experience.
