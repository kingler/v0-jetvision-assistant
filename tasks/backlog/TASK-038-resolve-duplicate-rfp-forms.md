# TASK-038: Resolve Duplicate RFP Forms

**Status**: ðŸ”´ Critical
**Priority**: URGENT
**Estimated Time**: 4 hours
**Assigned To**: Frontend Developer
**Created**: October 22, 2025
**Due Date**: Immediate (Week 1)

---

## 1. Task Overview

### Objective
Consolidate two separate RFP form implementations into a single, unified wizard-based form to eliminate user confusion and maintain a consistent user experience.

### User Story
```
As an ISO agent
I want a single, consistent way to create RFP requests
So that I don't get confused by multiple entry points with different workflows
```

### Business Value
- **Critical UX Issue**: Two separate forms confuse users and create inconsistent data
- **Brand Quality**: Duplicate implementations appear unprofessional
- **Maintenance**: Single codebase is easier to maintain and test
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures all RFPs follow the same validation and structure

### Success Metrics
- âœ… Only one RFP creation form exists in codebase
- âœ… All routes redirect to unified wizard
- âœ… Existing functionality preserved (client selection, validation, draft saving)
- âœ… No breaking changes to API contracts
- âœ… Tests pass with >80% coverage

## 2. Requirements & Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

**FR-1: Consolidate Form Implementations**
- Remove duplicate form at `/app/dashboard/new-request/page.tsx`
- Keep wizard-based form at `/app/rfp/new/page.tsx`
- Preserve all features from both implementations

**FR-2: Route Consolidation**
- Redirect `/dashboard/new-request` â†’ `/rfp/new`
- Update all navigation links to use `/rfp/new`
- Update dashboard "New Request" button

**FR-3: Feature Parity**

- All form fields from both implementations
- Validation from both forms (merge rules)
- Draft auto-save functionality (from wizard)
- Success/error handling (from both)

**FR-4: Migration Path**

## 3. Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

### Step 1: Write Tests FIRST (Red Phase)

**Test Files to Create**:
```
__tests__/unit/app/rfp/new/unified-form.test.tsx
__tests__/integration/app/rfp/new/form-submission.test.ts
__tests__/e2e/rfp/create-request-flow.spec.ts
```

**Example Test**:
```typescript
// __tests__/unit/app/rfp/new/unified-form.test.tsx
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from 'vitest'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import RFPNewPage from '@/app/rfp/new/page'

describe('Unified RFP Form', () => {
  it('should render all required form fields', () => {
    render(<RFPNewPage />)

    // Fields from wizard
    expect(screen.getByLabelText(/client name/i)).toBeInTheDocument()
    expect(screen.getByLabelText(/departure airport/i)).toBeInTheDocument()

    // Fields from old form
    expect(screen.getByLabelText(/client selection/i)).toBeInTheDocument()
    expect(screen.getByLabelText(/special requirements/i)).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('should redirect old route to new route', async () => {
    // Test navigation from /dashboard/new-request redirects to /rfp/new
  })
})
```

### Step 2: Implement Minimal Code (Green Phase)

**Implementation Checklist**:
- [ ] Merge form field schemas from both forms
- [ ] Update RFP wizard with missing fields
- [ ] Add route redirect
- [ ] Update navigation links
- [ ] Remove old form file

### Step 3: Refactor (Blue Phase)

**Refactoring Checklist**:
- [ ] Extract repeated validation logic to shared utilities
- [ ] Simplify form state management
- [ ] Improve component organization
- [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments

---

## 4. Implementation Steps

### Pre-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Review both existing form implementations
- [ ] Document all fields from each form
- [ ] Compare validation schemas
- [ ] Identify unique features in each form
- [ ] Map data flow for both forms

### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Step 1**: Analyze Both Forms
```bash
# Read old form
code app/dashboard/new-request/page.tsx

# Read wizard form
code app/rfp/new/page.tsx
code components/rfp/rfp-form-wizard.tsx
```

**Step 2**: Create Comparison Document
```markdown
# Form Feature Comparison

## Old Form (/dashboard/new-request)
- Client dropdown with existing clients
- Special requirements textarea
- Budget field
- Aircraft type selection
- Single-page form

## Wizard Form (/rfp/new)
- Multi-step wizard (4 steps)
- VIP status badges
- Draft auto-save
- Step-by-step validation
- Progress indicator
```

**Step 3**: Merge Schemas
File: `lib/validations/rfp-form-schema.ts`
```typescript
// Add missing fields from old form
export const rfpFormSchema = z.object({
  // Existing fields...

  // Add from old form:
  budget: z.number().optional(),
  specialRequirements: z.string().optional(),
  // ... merge all unique fields
})
```

**Step 4**: Update Wizard Steps
```typescript
// Add client dropdown to ClientSelectionStep
// Add special requirements to PreferencesStep
// Add budget to PreferencesStep
```

**Step 5**: Create Route Redirect
File: `app/dashboard/new-request/page.tsx`
```typescript
'use client';

import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function RedirectToRFPNew() {
  useEffect(() => {
    redirect('/rfp/new');
  }, []);

  return null;
}
```

**Step 6**: Update Navigation Links
```bash
# Find all references to old route
grep -r "/dashboard/new-request" app/ components/

# Update each file:
# app/dashboard/page.tsx:125 - Update button href
# components/header.tsx - Update navigation link
```

**Step 7**: Remove Old Implementation
```bash
# After confirming redirects work
# Remove old form (but keep the redirect file)
# Keep: app/dashboard/new-request/page.tsx (redirect only)
```

## 10. Notes & Questions

### Implementation Notes
Two separate RFP forms found during UI/UX analysis:
1. Single-page form at `/dashboard/new-request`
2. Multi-step wizard at `/rfp/new`

This creates user confusion and maintenance burden.

### Open Questions
- [ ] Which form has been used more by users? (Check analytics)
- [ ] Are there any draft RFPs saved with old form structure?
- [ ] Should we migrate any existing drafts?

### Assumptions
- Wizard-based form provides better UX (step-by-step)
- All features from both forms can be merged
- Redirects are acceptable for backward compatibility

### Risks/Blockers
- **Risk**: Users have bookmarked old URL
  - **Mitigation**: Implement permanent redirect (301)
- **Risk**: Third-party links point to old URL
  - **Mitigation**: Redirect will handle this
