## Why Archived?

### Business Decision
The JetVision AI Assistant is designed as a **conversational, chat-first application**. The dashboard was added during development but created a friction point in the user experience:

**Original Flow** (with dashboard):
```
Sign In → Dashboard → Navigate to Chat → Start Conversation
```

**Current Flow** (chat-first):
```
Sign In → Chat Interface → Start Conversation Immediately
```

### Technical Reasons
1. **User Experience**: Eliminated unnecessary navigation step
2. **Simplicity**: Reduced cognitive load for new users
3. **Focus**: Emphasized AI agent interaction as primary feature
4. **Mobile**: Better mobile experience without dashboard complexity

---

## Reactivation Process

When dashboard functionality is needed again, follow these steps:

### 1. Restore Dashboard to Active Routing

```bash
# Create new dashboard directory
mkdir -p app/dashboard/{analytics,clients,quotes,requests,rfp}

# Copy files from archive
cp app/dashboard-archived/page.tsx app/dashboard/
cp app/dashboard-archived/layout.tsx app/dashboard/
cp app/dashboard-archived/new-request-page.tsx app/dashboard/new-request/page.tsx
cp app/dashboard-archived/quotes/page.tsx app/dashboard/quotes/
cp app/dashboard-archived/analytics/page.tsx app/dashboard/analytics/
cp app/dashboard-archived/clients/client-detail-page.tsx app/dashboard/clients/[id]/page.tsx
cp app/dashboard-archived/requests/request-detail-page.tsx app/dashboard/requests/[id]/page.tsx
cp app/dashboard-archived/rfp/page.tsx app/dashboard/rfp/
cp app/dashboard-archived/rfp/rfp-detail-page.tsx app/dashboard/rfp/[id]/page.tsx

# Restore RFP form
mkdir -p app/rfp/new
cp app/rfp-archived/new-page.tsx app/rfp/new/page.tsx
```

### 2. Update Authentication Redirects

Edit `.env.local`:
```env
# Change from chat-first:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/

# To dashboard-first:
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard
```

### 3. Add Dashboard Navigation

Update `app/page.tsx` or `app/layout.tsx` to include dashboard link:

```tsx
<nav>
  <Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
  <Link href="/">Chat</Link>
</nav>
```

### 4. Test All Routes

- `/dashboard` - Dashboard home
- `/dashboard/new-request` - New RFP form
- `/dashboard/quotes` - Quote comparison
- `/dashboard/analytics` - Analytics page
- `/dashboard/clients/[id]` - Client details
- `/dashboard/requests/[id]` - Request details
- `/dashboard/rfp` - RFP list
- `/dashboard/rfp/[id]` - RFP details
- `/rfp/new` - Alternative RFP form

## Dependencies

All dashboard pages depend on:

### API Routes
- `GET /api/requests` - Fetch requests
- `POST /api/requests` - Create request
- `GET /api/quotes` - Fetch quotes
- `PATCH /api/quotes/:id` - Update quote
- `GET /api/clients` - Fetch clients
- `POST /api/clients` - Create client
- `GET /api/workflows` - Fetch workflow states
- `POST /api/agents/*` - Trigger agent actions

### Components
- `@/components/ui/*` - shadcn/ui component library
- `@/components/aviation/*` - Aviation-specific components
- `@/components/rfp/*` - RFP form components

### Authentication
- `@clerk/nextjs` - Clerk authentication
  - `useAuth()` - Auth state
  - `UserButton` - User menu
  - `ClerkProvider` - Auth context

### Database
- All pages expect Supabase schema to be deployed
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies must be active

---

## Notes

### Code Quality
- ✅ All TypeScript types intact
- ✅ Full Clerk authentication integration
- ✅ API route connections functional
- ✅ Responsive design maintained
- ✅ No code modifications during archival

### Testing
- ⚠️ Dashboard pages were not unit tested before archival
- ⚠️ Integration tests may be needed upon reactivation
- ⚠️ API routes should be tested with dashboard before going live

### Known Issues
None - code was working when archived. However, verify:
1. Supabase schema is current
2. API routes still exist
3. RFP form components still available
