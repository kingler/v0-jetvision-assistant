| Feature / User Story | Status | Est. Completion | Evidence & Notes |
|----------------------|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Authentication & Access Control | âœ… | 95% | Clerk middleware protects all non-public routes (`middleware.ts`), sign-in/up flows with chat-first redirects (`app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`). Unit tests cover auth helper behavior (`__tests__/unit/auth/clerk-auth.test.ts`). |
| User Profile & RBAC Management | âœ… | 90% | Profile UI with update API (`app/settings/profile/page.tsx`, `/api/users/me`), admin user directory (`app/admin/users/page.tsx`), RBAC helper (`lib/middleware/rbac.ts`) and corresponding tests (`__tests__/unit/middleware/rbac.test.ts`). |
| Quick Flight Request Processing (User Story 1) | ðŸŸ¡ | 55% | Backend can create requests and trigger orchestrator (`app/api/requests/route.ts`), but chat UI still posts simulated workflows (`app/page.tsx`). Need real request form bindings + validations. |
| Automated Client Profile Retrieval (User Story 2) | ðŸŸ¡ | 50% | Client Data Agent integrates Sheets MCP (`agents/implementations/client-data-agent.ts`), yet chat never calls it and Sheets credentials workflow undocumented for runtime. |
| Real-Time Quote Tracking (User Story 3) | ðŸŸ¡ | 60% | Supabase realtime hook implemented (`hooks/use-rfp-realtime.ts`) and quotes API live (`app/api/quotes/route.ts`), but dashboard/chat rely on mocked quotes; no UI subscription wiring. |
| AI-Powered Proposal Analysis (User Story 4) | ðŸŸ¢ | 70% | Proposal Analysis Agent scores/ranks quotes (`agents/implementations/proposal-analysis-agent.ts`), quote cards UI ready (`components/aviation/quote-card.tsx`), requires integration to display real agent output. |
| Automated Proposal Generation (User Story 5) | ðŸŸ¡ | 45% | Communication Agent drafts email bodies (`agents/implementations/communication-agent.ts`), but PDF service and Gmail MCP invocation path not wired to workflow; no tests for email send success. |
| Multi-Request Management (User Story 6) | ðŸŸ¡ | 50% | Chat sidebar lists sessions using mock seed (`lib/mock-data.ts`); persistence via Supabase or Redis absent, no filtering/search implemented. |
| Workflow Visibility (User Story 7) | ðŸŸ¡ | 60% | Workflow visualization component exists (`components/workflow-visualization.tsx`) and chat agent service emits workflow events, but UI consumes static flags from simulation in `components/chat-interface.tsx`. |
| Proposal Delivery to Client (User Story 8) | ðŸ”´ | 20% | Email scaffolding present in Communication Agent and Gmail MCP server, yet there is no end-to-end trigger, PDF generation (`tasks/backlog/TASK-019`) not implemented, and no delivery tracking UI. |
| MCP Server Suite | ðŸŸ¢ | 75% | Avinode/Gmail/Sheets/Supabase servers expose tools with schema validation (`mcp-servers/**/src`). Requires credential smoke tests and deployment docs updates. |
| Testing & QA Framework | ðŸŸ¡ | 30% | Vitest suites for agents/APIs/hooks exist (`__tests__/unit/**`), but coverage remains <1% and integration/E2E specs are placeholders (`tests/*.spec.ts`). |

## Summary

- **Completed**: Authentication, RBAC/profile management, MCP server scaffolding.  
- **Nearly Done**: Proposal analysis logic, request/quote APIs, workflow visual components.  
- **In Progress**: Chat-to-backend integration, realtime updates, client data enrichment, automated communications.  
- **Not Started**: Production-grade proposal delivery (PDF + Gmail send confirmation), persistent chat session store, comprehensive QA automation.
