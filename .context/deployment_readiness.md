# Deployment Readiness Assessment

**Project**: JetVision AI Assistant  
**Assessment Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Readiness Verdict**: ❌ **Not Ready for Production** – core user experience still relies on mocks, automated coverage is below acceptable thresholds, and infrastructure dependencies are unvalidated.

---

## Environment & Infrastructure

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Supabase | 🟡 Provisioned but unvalidated | Migrations & types exist (`supabase/migrations/**`), yet no integration smoke tests or seed scripts are executed against a live instance. |
| Redis / BullMQ | 🔴 Not provisioned | Agent queue defaults to localhost Redis (`agents/coordination/task-queue.ts`); no deployment plan or health checks defined. |
| MCP Servers | 🟠 Implemented, not deployed | Avinode/Gmail/Sheets/Supabase servers run locally but lack credential validation, monitoring, or hosting targets. |
| OpenAI | 🟢 Configured | `lib/config/openai-config.ts` defines model usage; environment variables exist in `.env.example` but no runtime verification. |
| CI/CD | 🔴 Missing | No GitHub Actions or build pipelines defined; manual deploy risk remains high. |
| Monitoring/Logging | 🟡 Partial | Sentry configs checked in (`sentry.*.config.ts`), but no DSN wiring or dashboard verification. |

## Application Quality Gates

- **Automated Tests**: Coverage report shows **0.7% statements** and <20% for functions (`coverage/lcov-report/index.html`). Critical paths (auth, requests, agents) lack integration/E2E coverage.  
- **Manual QA**: Last documented QA session predates current features (`.context/QA_TESTING_REPORT.md`); no recent smoke test evidence.  
- **Type Safety**: `pnpm type-check` not recorded; agent types appear strict but require CI enforcement.  
- **Performance**: No load testing or queue throughput metrics captured; BullMQ concurrency defaults may not match production workloads.  
- **Security**: Clerk auth + Supabase RLS configured, yet webhook secret management and MCP OAuth flows remain untested.

## Data & Migration Readiness

- Eight SQL migrations define schema, indexes, and RLS. Need to confirm successful execution on target Supabase project and generate baseline data seeds.  
- No rollback strategy documented; recommend adding migration verification script prior to deploy.  
- Supabase type generation file (`lib/types/database.ts`) must remain synchronized with migrations; integrate into CI to prevent drift.

## Outstanding Blocking Items

1. Connect chat UI to live APIs (remove mocks, persist sessions, surface real workflow updates).  
2. Achieve minimum automated coverage (≥70% statements) with integration tests for `/api/requests`, `/api/quotes`, agent orchestrations, and MCP calls.  
3. Provision and validate Redis, Supabase, and MCP credentials in the target environment; add health checks and failure alerts.  
4. Implement proposal delivery pipeline (PDF generation + Gmail send) and validate end-to-end acceptance flow.  
5. Establish CI/CD pipeline with lint/type/test/build gates and deployment targets (e.g., Vercel + MCP hosting).  
6. Update project management artefacts to reflect real status and ensure alignment with Linear issues prior to release planning.

## Next Steps Toward Readiness

- Run a full staging rehearsal once blockers above are addressed: seed Supabase, execute agent workflow on sample request, validate real-time UI, and deliver a proposal email/PDF.  
- Capture metrics (latency, queue duration, MCP call success) during rehearsal and feed into observability dashboard.  
- Prepare rollback and incident response playbooks before opening production traffic.
