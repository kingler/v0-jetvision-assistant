**Delivery Confidence**: 75% (Medium-High) - **Improved from 65%**

**Factors**:
- ✅ Strong foundation reduces implementation risk
- ✅ All agents and MCP servers implemented
- ✅ Clear plan and comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Database schema complete
- ⚠️ On schedule but testing is behind
- ⚠️ TypeScript errors need immediate attention
- ⚠️ External dependencies need setup

### Next Milestone
