# Overall Project Status Report

**Project**: JetVision AI Assistant  
**Analysis Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Analyst**: Codex Codebase Review Agent

---

## Executive Snapshot

- **Overall Completion (est.)**: **62%** – major application layers are implemented, but chat UX and production readiness need integration work.  
- **Delivery Health**: 🟡 **At Risk** – backend, agents, and MCP connectors are code-complete, yet UI still runs on mocked data and test coverage is insufficient for deployment.  
- **Critical Path**: wire chat UI to live APIs, harden data workflows, raise automated coverage, and validate MCP credentials in staging.

## Completion by Area

| Area | Status | Completion | Key Evidence |
|------|--------|------------|--------------|
| Infrastructure & Tooling | ✅ Stable | **90%** | Strict TS config, linting, Husky, path aliases, task runner, OpenAI/Supabase clients (`tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `lib/config/openai-config.ts`). |
| Authentication & User Management | ✅ Feature Complete | **85%** | Clerk middleware guard (`middleware.ts`), sign-in/up flows redirect to chat, profile management UI & API (`app/settings/profile/page.tsx`, `app/api/users/me/route.ts`), RBAC helper (`lib/middleware/rbac.ts`). |
| Backend APIs & Data Layer | 🟢 Mostly Complete | **75%** | REST routes for requests, quotes, agents, workflows (`app/api/**`), Supabase migrations + types (`supabase/migrations/**`, `lib/types/database.ts`). |
| AI Agents & Workflow Engine | 🟢 Implemented | **80%** | Six agent classes with coordination/queueing (`agents/implementations/*`, `agents/coordination/task-queue.ts`), chat agent service (`lib/services/chat-agent-service.ts`). |
| External Integrations (MCP) | 🟢 Implemented | **70%** | Avinode/Gmail/Sheets/Supabase MCP servers with tool schemas (`mcp-servers/*`), but credential validation pending. |
| Frontend UX | 🟡 In Progress | **60%** | Chat shell, workflow viz, quote comparison UI in place (`components/chat-interface.tsx`, `components/aviation/quote-card.tsx`), yet chat still uses mock sessions and simulated workflow. |
| Testing & QA | 🔴 Behind | **25%** | 38 Vitest suites exist, but coverage report shows **0.7% statements** (`coverage/lcov-report/index.html`); integration with live services untested. |
| DevOps & Deployment | 🟠 Started | **40%** | Env templates & docs complete, Supabase CLI configured, but CI/CD, Redis infra, staging/prod deployment steps remain TODO (`tasks/backlog/TASK-024`, `docs/deployment/**`). |

## Progress Highlights

- **Robust backend foundation**: Requests, quotes, users, workflows, and chat streaming endpoints enforce Clerk auth and Supabase RLS (`app/api/requests/route.ts`, `app/api/chat/respond/route.ts`).
- **Agent ecosystem in place**: Orchestrator delegates to specialized agents with BullMQ queues, error handling, and metrics instrumentation (`agents/implementations/orchestrator-agent.ts`, `agents/coordination/task-queue.ts`).
- **MCP connectors ready**: Standalone servers expose typed tools for Avinode search, Gmail sending, Google Sheets sync, and Supabase queries (`mcp-servers/**/src`).
- **Supabase schema codified**: Eight migrations cover users, requests, quotes, workflow state, with generated TypeScript typings and real-time hooks (`supabase/migrations/*.sql`, `hooks/use-rfp-realtime.ts`).
- **User administration UX**: Admin listing and profile update flows consume `/api/users` routes, providing RBAC-aware management surfaces (`app/admin/users/page.tsx`, `app/settings/profile/page.tsx`).

## Outstanding Gaps

1. **Chat UI still mocked** – `app/page.tsx` relies on `simulateWorkflowProgress` and `lib/mock-data.ts`; live streaming hook (`hooks/use-streaming-response.ts`) is unused.
2. **Test coverage immature** – Coverage report shows <1% execution; Supabase, agents, and MCP flows lack integration/E2E validation.
3. **Operational readiness** – Redis/BullMQ infra, MCP credential management, CI/CD, and monitoring (Sentry dashboards) are not exercised.
4. **Task & documentation drift** – `tasks/TASK_INDEX.md` and individual task files still mark core items as “pending” despite code completion, risking coordination issues.
5. **Agent-service heuristics** – `lib/services/chat-agent-service.ts` uses keyword heuristics for intent; needs GPT-powered routing or deterministic rules before launch.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Signal | Mitigation |
|------|----------|--------|------------|
| Chat <> backend disconnect | 🔴 High | Frontend runs on mocks, no production feedback loop | Replace simulation with `useStreamingResponse`, persist messages via `/api/chat/respond`, backfill Supabase data access. |
| Test coverage deficit | 🔴 High | Coverage 0.7% statements, minimal branch testing | Prioritize critical-path tests (auth, requests, quotes, agents), enable CI gating via `pnpm test:coverage`. |
| Infrastructure validation | 🟠 Medium | Redis/MCP credentials not validated end-to-end | Provision sandbox Redis/Supabase, run smoke tests for each MCP tool, document secrets rotation. |
| Documentation drift | 🟡 Medium | Tasks + status reports outdated | Refresh `tasks/` statuses, align with Linear sync script (`scripts/linear/link-issues-to-project.js`). |
| Performance assumptions | 🟡 Medium | Queue sizing, Supabase query performance unbenchmarked | Add load tests/benchmarks once integration complete. |

## Validation & Testing Notes

- Automated coverage: **Statements 0.7% (117/16,493)**, **Branches 28.84% (45/156)**, **Functions 17.91% (137/765)** (`coverage/lcov-report/index.html`).
- Unit tests rely heavily on mocks; no Supabase emulator or MCP sandbox usage in specs (`__tests__/unit/api/*.test.ts`).
- No Playwright/Cypress E2E runs recorded; `tests/` directory contains placeholders awaiting activation.
- Manual QA evidence limited to prior `.context/QA_TESTING_REPORT.md` (needs refresh).

## Forecast & Next Milestones

1. **Hook Chat to Live Agents (P0)** – integrate streaming hook, persist sessions, surface workflow updates from Supabase. Target: 1 sprint.
2. **Stabilize Data Backbone (P0)** – seed Supabase, validate RLS via integration tests, implement archival queries in UI. Target: 1 sprint.
3. **Quality Gate (P0)** – Achieve ≥70% UI / ≥80% API coverage with Vitest + Playwright, enforce via CI. Target: 2 sprints.
4. **Production Readiness (P1)** – Stand up Redis, configure CI/CD, verify MCP credentials, add Sentry dashboards. Target: 2-3 sprints after quality gate.

**Deployment Readiness**: ❌ Not yet ready – key user flows depend on mocks and lack automated validation.
