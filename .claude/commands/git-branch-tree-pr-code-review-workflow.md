# Comprehensive Git Workflow for AI-Orchestrated Test-Driven Development

## Prerequisites & Context Required

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** This workflow requires the following information to be fully customized:
- **Project Description**: {{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}} - Please provide details about your project type, tech stack, and architecture
- **Feature Requirements**: {{FEATURE_REQUIREMENTS}} - Please specify the features to be implemented

**Note:** The workflow below is a comprehensive template that can be adapted once the above information is provided.

---

## Implementation Model

This workflow is **implementation-agnostic** and can operate in several modes:

1. **Guided Mode**: AI agents suggest commands/code; humans execute Git operations
2. **Semi-Automated**: AI agents produce outputs; CI/CD tools execute operations
3. **Fully Automated**: AI agents integrated with Git automation tools (requires infrastructure setup)

For practical purposes, this guide assumes **Guided Mode** where AI agents provide specifications and a coordinator (human or automation system) executes the Git commands.

        # Test implementation
        pass
    
    def test_login_fails_with_invalid_password(self):
        """Verify login is rejected with incorrect password"""
        pass
    
    def test_account_lockout_after_failed_attempts(self):
        """Verify account locks after N failed login attempts"""
        pass
    
    # Additional tests...
```

**Git Operations:**
```bash
git add tests/
git commit -m "test: Add comprehensive test suite for <feature-name>

- Added tests for happy path scenarios

        self.max_attempts = max_attempts
        self.failed_attempts = {}
    
    def login(self, username, password):
        """
        Authenticate user with credentials
        
        Args:
            username (str): User's username
            password (str): User's password
            
        Returns:
            bool: True if authentication successful
            
        Raises:
            AccountLockedException: If account is locked
        """
        # Implementation
        pass
```

**Git Operations:**
```bash
git add src/
git commit -m "feat: Implement <feature-name> initial version

- Added core functionality for X

- Integration issues found during PR review
- Tests fail after merging latest main

**Steps:**
1. Detect and analyze conflicts

**Git Operations:**
```bash
git checkout feature/<feature-name>
git fetch origin main
git merge origin/main
# If conflicts occur, document them
git status
git diff
```

2. Generate detailed conflict report

**Conflict Report Template:**
```markdown
# Conflict Resolution Report
**Feature Branch:** feature/<feature-name>
**Target Branch:** main
**Detection Date:** <date>

## Conflict Summary
- **Total Conflicts:** X files
- **Conflict Type:** Merge conflict / Test failure / Build error
- **Severity:** High / Medium / Low

## Conflicting Files
### File: src/auth.py
**Lines:** 45-67
**Conflict Type:** Both branches modified same section

**Current Branch (feature):**
```python
def login(self, username, password):
    # Our implementation
```

**Target Branch (main):**
```python
def authenticate(self, username, password):
    # Changed method name in main
```

**Root Cause:** Main branch refactored method naming while feature was in development

**Recommended Resolution:**
1. Adopt main branch method name (`authenticate`)
2. Update all references in feature branch
3. Update tests to match new method name
4. Re-run full test suite

## Resolution Strategy
1. [Step-by-step resolution plan]
2. [Files to modify]
3. [Tests to update]
4. [Verification steps]

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk of Resolution:** Low / Medium / High
- **Potential Issues:** [What could go wrong]
- **Mitigation:** [How to reduce risk]
```

3. Coordinate with Coding Agent for resolution

**Git Operations (after resolution):**
```bash
# Resolve conflicts manually or via Coding Agent
git add <resolved-files>
git commit -m "merge: Resolve conflicts with main branch

- Adopted new authenticate() method name from main
- Updated all method calls in feature code
- Updated test suite to match new signatures
- All tests passing after conflict resolution"
git push origin feature/<feature-name>
```

4. Verify resolution

**Verification Steps:**
```bash
# Re-run full test suite
pytest

# Run linters/static analysis
flake8 src/

# Build project (if applicable)
python setup.py build

# Integration tests
pytest tests/integration/
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ All conflicts identified and documented
- ‚úÖ Resolution strategy clearly defined

# Verify no new commits on main since last update
git log HEAD..origin/main  # Should show nothing
```

2. Perform merge

**Git Operations:**
```bash
# Option 1: Merge via PR (preferred - maintains PR history)
gh pr merge <PR-number> --merge

# Option 2: Direct merge (if not using PR platform)
git checkout main

**Procedure:**
1. Coding Agent analyzes test failures
2. Determine if failure is due to:
   - **Bug in implementation** ‚Üí Coding Agent fixes
   - **Incorrect test expectations** ‚Üí Test Agent reviews and updates tests
   - **Misunderstood requirements** ‚Üí Escalate for requirement clarification
3. Make corrections and re-run
4. Document the issue and resolution

---

### Code Review Rejection

**Scenario:** Code Review Agent rejects implementation (Phase 4)

**Handler:** Coding Agent

**Procedure:**
1. Review rejection reasons in detail
2. If major redesign needed:

**Procedure:**
1. Conflict Resolution Agent creates detailed analysis
2. Options:
   - **Option A:** Rebase feature branch on current main
     ```bash
     git checkout feature/<feature-name>
     git fetch origin main
     git rebase origin/main
     # Resolve conflicts step by step
     git rebase --continue
     git push --force-with-lease origin feature/<feature-name>
     ```
   - **Option B:** Cherry-pick approach
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>-rebased origin/main
     git cherry-pick <commits>
     # Resolve conflicts as needed
     ```
   - **Option C:** Recreate feature from scratch on current main
     (Last resort for severe conflicts)
3. Re-run full workflow from Phase 2
4. Document conflict resolution approach in commit messages

---

### CI/CD Pipeline Failures

**Scenario:** Automated checks fail during PR

**Handler:** Conflict Resolution Agent ‚Üí Coding Agent

**Procedure:**
1. Analyze failure logs
2. Categorize failure type:
   - Build errors ‚Üí Coding Agent fixes
   - Test failures ‚Üí Coding Agent + Test Agent collaborate
   - Linting/style issues ‚Üí Coding Agent fixes
   - Deployment issues ‚Üí May require infrastructure team
3. Fix and re-push
4. Verify all checks pass

## Coordination & Handoff Protocol

### Agent Communication Format

When handing off between agents, use this format:

```markdown
## Handoff: [From Agent] ‚Üí [To Agent]
**Phase:** [Phase number and name]
**Status:** [Complete / Needs Attention / Blocked]

### Context
[What was accomplished]

### Artifacts
- [Files created/modified]
- [Commits made]
- [Reports generated]

### Next Steps
[What the receiving agent should do]

### Blockers
[Any issues or dependencies]
```

### State Tracking

Maintain a workflow state file in the repository:

```yaml
# .workflow-state.yml
current_phase: 4
feature_branch: feature/user-authentication
feature_name: User Authentication
started_at: 2024-01-15T10:00:00Z

phases_completed:
  - phase: 1
    agent: Pull Request Agent
    completed_at: 2024-01-15T10:05:00Z
  - phase: 2
    agent: Test Agent
    completed_at: 2024-01-15T11:30:00Z
  - phase: 3
    agent: Coding Agent
    completed_at: 2024-01-15T14:00:00Z

current_status:
  agent: Code Review Agent
  action: Reviewing initial implementation
  issues_found: 2
  severity: Medium

next_action:
  agent: Coding Agent
  task: Address code review feedback
```

---

## Implementation Notes

### Execution Requirements

This workflow assumes the following infrastructure:

1. **Git Repository Access**: Agents need ability to execute Git commands or a coordinator who can execute them
2. **Test Execution Environment**: Ability to run project tests
3. **Code Analysis Tools**: Linters, formatters, security scanners
4. **Communication System**: Way for agents to share artifacts and handoff work

### Practical Implementation Approaches

**Approach 1: Human Coordinator**
- AI agents provide specifications
- Human executes Git commands
- Best for initial adoption

**Approach 2: Automation Scripts**
- Scripts execute Git operations based on agent outputs
- Requires scripting infrastructure
- Good for repeated workflows

**Approach 3: CI/CD Integration**
- Agents trigger pipeline steps
- Platform handles Git operations
- Best for production environments
